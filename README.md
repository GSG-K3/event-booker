# Proplem
GSG Create Events Frequent , and the members of event in some time up to hundred, GSG logistics and operations admin using 4 ipads to the registration Newcomers , and take attendance.

Newcomers will need to log in their info; name, age, profession/university, location and phone number into the GSG system at the door when they come in. But once they’re in the co-working space and at their event, they need to fill in another google form that logs them in using their phone numbers as attendees for this specific event. This entire process makes GSG logistics and operations admin  feels the annoyance resulting from it by the attendees as it can distract them from focusing on the content of the event that’s being presented, and add a lot to the noise that may come as a result of moving the ipads around and asking individuals if they’ve logged their info, over and over again. 

# Solution
Create WebSite where events attendees can register for one or more events, and enter their info. Also they can sing up if they register for the first time or login.  The website sends a code for each attendee to approve his attendance in the event.
